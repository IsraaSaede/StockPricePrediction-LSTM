# Stock Price Prediction Project

## Introduction
This project aims to predict stock prices using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. We'll use historical stock data, preprocess it, train an LSTM model, and visualize the predictions against actual stock prices.

# Stock Price Prediction 
Stock price prediction involves forecasting future movements in stock prices based on historical data, market trends, and other factors. It employs various techniques such as machine learning algorithms, time series analysis, and sentiment analysis to anticipate price fluctuations, aiding investors in making informed decisions regarding buying, selling, or holding stocks.

# LSTM
(Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture designed to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and capture long-term dependencies in sequential data. With specialized memory cells, it can selectively remember or forget information over time, making it effective for tasks like time series prediction and natural language processing.

## Getting Started
To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Install the required libraries (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, keras).
2. Load the dataset.
3. Preprocess the data.
4. Train the LSTM model.
5. Evaluate the model.
6. Visualize the predictions.
